Shebang
------- 
Currently the project is at the brainstorming stange researching into
what's possible and what can't be done.

Problem
-------
On my laptop i have three internet connections.

  1. Wifi
  2. Lan
  3. 3G

But I can only use one.

Solution
-------
Zero Config Daemon/Service for (Linux, Mac, Windows, Iphone Android) which utilizes multiple available internet connections scans for type of connection and available bandwidth using minimal cpu/mem resources with optimal benefits.

Thoughts
-------
There are infinite solutions which come to my mind round robin fifo, depending on the link speed split the number of connections but do care for https connections being made from one ip. I need to discuss these things with somebody and know why Windows Mac haven't already done this why is this so difficult.

Support
-------
I am a novice engineer and looking for support, especially advice.
